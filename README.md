# Music Full Stack Application
This application will mimic a music website downloader; unsure if I will integrate actual mp4 files but abilities I would like to create are:<br>

- Admin page(s) that has the ability to create, remove, and update data on the website

- User Interface(s)
    - a page to see and search through songs
    - ability to view a songs information on it's own page, info like
        - artist(s)
        - lyrics
        - release year
    - a download song mimic
